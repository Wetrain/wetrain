## 2017 in review

I've decided to start a yearly habit, in order to provide a reflection of my year. That habit is writing a yearly review on my blog. It's something that i feel is great asset to have as you progress through a new task/career/life.
The first review will be somewhat vague as I have the task of reviewing the entire year, but future iterations will hopefully be more concise, as i will be building it throughout the year, as I succeed, improve and fail.

## January - July

This may seem at first like a long time gap to review, but 2017 for me was a year of change and making a leap into the "grown up world", or as British parents say "Welcome to the real world". During this stint of time I
was finishing the last year of my degree in Computer Science at Manchester Metropolitan University. The university period of my life was interesting and extremely challenging, I'm still glad I went and completed my degree, but I do feel
the need improve on what I learnt there in many ways.

Over this period of time I was around half way through my final units at university which were:

 - Computer Architectures
 - Artificial Intelligence
 - Enterprise Programming
 - Dissertation (Research)

# Computer Architectures
This unit was probably my favourite unit of the year, and also the most challenging. The unit was split into two separate units, one which explored programming languages and why we have such a diverse set of them and the other which saw us build a compiler
from scratch using Antlr. The programming languages unit was very useful in learning the history of Computer Science and why/where each language came from, in order to solve different issues/problems at that time and also how some languages are still evolving to solve new modern day problems, each task was to learn/utilise the language to solve a diverse set of problem, which was very useful in gaining a real understanding as to why those languages were used in practical terms. The compiler unit however was extremely challenging, but also very interesting, understand how a compiler breaks down an arbitrary set of symbols into groups and then converts these symbols into machine code is very rewarding. However this unit was restricted by time limits, which meant I was restricted in how far I could in understanding it all at once.

# Artificial Intelligence
Artificial intelligence, was the most stressful unit I took during university, for all of the wrong reasons. The course was lead by people who felt it was necessary to teach the entire domain of AI in a single term at a PHD mathematics level,
to a room full of undergrads. This unit taught me the importance of speaking out against such poor performance at the university. The actual materials were too poorly taught to actually gain any valuable understanding from them.

# Enterprise Programming
This unit was the easiest unit I took during my final year, however it was still rewarding/useful, the unit consisted of understand/building trusted technologies throughout industry, such as robust web apps, APIs and databases, for this unit
I built a Django based web-app, which a Rest interface, which allowed for users to retrieve/modify data from a sever, which was hosted on the Heroku cloud platform.

# Dissertation 
My dissertation was the largest piece of work I produced whilst at university, it took the most independent thought/investigation along with a lot of help from peers and my excellent project lead Souffiene.
The research topic was based around understanding how future smart cities, along with smart vehicles, could be used to reduce travel time and congestions on the road network. For the research I had to investigate the cutting edge
of this field, why research like this should be undertaken, my own novel solution to how I could help solve the problem and finally research into how well my solution performed. After discussion with my project lead, I decided to investigate how
bus lanes affect congestion in cities and what solutions could be utilised to make them more efficient. My proposed solution was implemented in an open source simulator called SUMO and produced some interesting results, my paper was also presented at 
a IEEE conference, if you would like to read more into the solution/results as I do not fancy writing my dissertation again, please see the link [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B_hMezUpeg22V0ZkMmQxbno0VWM).

Overall university was a fun time and opened up a lot more doors for me in the future, I also met some fantastic friends for life and had some great experiences. I also managed to graduate with a first class honours degree and also received a prize
from the O'Reilly foundation for achieving the highest grade in my dissertation in the whole year.

## July - August
After university, I was extremely exhausted and wanted some time to relax and adventure a bit, so this year me, my girlfriend and parents went on a cruise! This was my first cruise and we were all sceptical as to what we would thing of it.
The plan for the holiday was to arrive in New York, spend a few days there, catch the ship, go to Florida, Bahamas, then back to NYC for a few more days exploring.

NY was awesome as most people would expect, although I particularly disliked Time Square, as from the photo you can see it was very busy/tourism hell!

Surprisingly the cruise was actually very nice and a lot less claustrophobic than one would expect, it also had a lot of food/entertainment/booze to keep most people entertained whilst cruising across the Atlantic :)

The best bit was visiting Cape Canaveral and getting the visit the Kennedy Space Centre :D 

## August - December
At the end of my degree, I began to apply for jobs in my local area of Manchester, I was looking for something different/more challenging than a typical graduate job in web, which lead me to find Codethink, I applied in June and 
got offered the job in July! So the final few months of the year have spent at my first graduate job \o/. Codethink is a company that specialises in Embedded/Automotive/Difficult software problems, they are huge open source advocates and also
many of the people who work at the company are open source contributors themselves. The company is extremely interesting to work for and they offer a lot of nice benefits and pay well, especially for my first graduate job.

My first 5 months at the company have been a roller coaster for sure, as getting used to working in the industry fresh out of university is hard, along with learning and improving on my technical skills and meeting deadlines. But it is all fun and rewarding
and I have been very happy so far :)

My first project is also open source, which is a project requiring me and others to look into converting a Yocto build baseruntime, into a new tool called Buildstream. 

My first project has introduced me to A LOT of new technologies such as:
 - Git
 - Python
 - Compilers
 - BuildTools
 - Docker
 - SSL
 - FlatPak
 - Buildstream

As you can see there are a lot of tools that I have picked up/explored in such a short time. 

## Goals for 2018
So the goal of this post is to really be able to realise how much I have achieved in a year/what I feel I should improve upon and as i'm constantly learning/improving my list of TODOs is constantly growing.

So for 2018 I shall leave a list of tasks that I would like to improve upon, then once I achieve one I shall tick it off the list.

Most of the areas I want to improve upon are currently work related, coming from university, you do not get a deep grounding in everything, you just get a flavour for each area, now I'm in an industry, I would like to be able to learn more
about this industry and take my skills to the next level, there are also some personal goals that I feel will benefit me as a person that I would also like to aim towards in the new year.

## Goals for 2018

- [ ] Learn C
- [ ] Learn more regarding Embedded protocols i2c, GPIO
- [ ] Learn more about how to use Buildstream
- [ ] Experiment with different build tools
- [ ] Improve my Discrete maths skills/Statistics
- [ ] Learn more about the Blockchain
- [ ] Gain a deeper understanding of AI systems
- [ ] Exercise more

This list will hopefully change/grow, but for now those are the things that bother me on a daily basis, so these will be my main focus.

I hope you new year is successful and productive!

Happy new year!
