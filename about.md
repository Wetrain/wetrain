Hi i'm Adam, a software developer based in Manchester, England.

I'm currently working @ Codethink, after recently graduating from University.

My interest do not really lie anywhere at the moment, but some of my favourites are:
 * Python
 * Unix
 * Good software design
 * Open Source software
 * Climbing
 * Cycling
